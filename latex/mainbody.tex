\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}


Emotion detection has attracted great interest 
in the natural language processing (NLP)
in the last few years.
In sentiment analysis, 
affective states are generally represented 
using either categorical or dimensional approaches.
The most popular categorical approach represents is 
Ekmanâ€™s six basic emotions 
(e.g., anger, happiness, fear, sadness, disgust and surprise)
The dimensional approach represents affective states by using
continuous numerical values in two/three dimensions,.
The valence-arousal (VA) dimensions model , 
as shown in ~\Cref{fig:va} . 
The valence represents the degree of 
positive and negative, 
while the arousal represents the degree of 
excitement and calm. 
In 1994,
Bradley and Lang proposed 
Valence- Arousal-Dominance model,
as shown in ~\Cref{fig:vad}.
And Dominance perceived degree of control in a (social) situation.
Based on this representation, 
any affective state can be represented as a point 
in the VA/VAD coordinate plane. 

In this paper, 
we want to predict  
multiple emotion dimension scores for an input text.
A new machine learning paradigm called 
Label Distribution Learning (LDL) 
was proposed in recently years.
Similarly,
we propose an dimensional emotion distribution learning (DEDL) algorithm
Different from the previous approaches, 
DEDL assumes that
each sentence contains a mixture of 
dimensional emotions with different intensities. 
We can label each sentence with 
an label distribution vector 
where elements corresponds to 
dimensional emotions and 
the value of each element indicates the intensity of the dimensional emotions. 
We require that each vector element has a value 
between 0 and 1 and they sum up to 1.

%%Based on this representation, any affective state can be represented as a point in the VA coordinate plane.
