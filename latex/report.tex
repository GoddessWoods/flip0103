\begin{abstract}

While research on emotions has become 
one of the most productive areas at 
the intersection of cognitive science, 
artificial intelligence and natural language processing,
the diversity and incommensurability of 
emotion models seriously hampers progress in the field.
Models of emotion are commonly divided into
categorical and dimensional ones.
Compared to the categorical approach
that represents affective states as 
several discrete classes (e.g., positive and negative),
the dimensional approach represents
affective states as continuous numerical values 
on multiple dimensions,
such as the valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) space,
thus allowing for 
more fine-grained sentiment analysis. 
In building dimensional sentiment applications, 
affective lexicons
with valence-arousal-dominance ratings are 
useful resources but 
are still very rare.
In this paper, 
we propose a novel approach
based on emotion distribution learning.
The key idea is to learn a mapping function
from sentences to their dimensional emotion distributions
by the proposed 
Dimensional Emotion Distribution Learning(DEDL)
method.
And then,
we use the predicted value of VAD and 
the notational VAD to 
classification the emotion category.
